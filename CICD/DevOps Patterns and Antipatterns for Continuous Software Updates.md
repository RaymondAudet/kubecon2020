# DevOps Patterns and Antipatterns for Continuous Software Updates
Speakers Baruch Sadogursky, Kat Cosgrove
_So, you want to update the software for your user, be it the nodes in your K8s cluster, a browser on user’s desktop, an app in user’s smartphone or even a user’s car. What can possibly go wrong? In this talk, we’ll analyze real-world software update failures and how multiple DevOps patterns, that fit a variety of scenarios, could have saved the developers. Manually making sure that everything works before sending update and expecting the user to do acceptance tests before they update is most definitely not on the list of such patterns. Join us for some awesome and scary continuous update horror stories and some obvious (and some not so obvious) proven ideas for improvement and best practices you can start following tomorrow._

 - we want new features
   - we update more and more often, smaller but faster
 - for security reasons 
   - stopping distances similarities (identify , fix, deploy)
   - the more we wait, the bigger it gets

delivery performances : 
  - to mesure how can we deliver faster and more stable
